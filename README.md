# Waste Management Using CNN Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify waste into categories such as "Organic" and "Recyclable." The goal is to automate waste classification processes, making them more efficient and accurate. By leveraging deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, this project showcases the potential of artificial intelligence in solving environmental challenges.

## Key Features
- Automated classification of waste images using a CNN.
- Data preprocessing and augmentation for enhanced model performance.
- Visualization of data distribution and model performance metrics.
- Real-world applications for sustainable waste management practices.

## Technical Details

### 1. Data Preparation
- Dataset: Images are organized into `TRAIN` and `TEST` directories.
- Preprocessing:
  - Images are resized and normalized to improve training efficiency.
  - OpenCV (`cv2`) is used for image reading and transformation.
- Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling are applied to improve generalization.

### 2. Model Architecture
The CNN is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras and includes the following layers:
- Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from input images using filters.
- MaxPooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps.
- Batch Normalization: Normalize activations to stabilize and speed up training.
- Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting by randomly dropping nodes during training.
- Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for final classification.

### 3. Training Details
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy to minimize classification errors.
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer for adaptive learning rate adjustments.
- Metrics: Accuracy and precision-recall metrics to evaluate performance.
- Visualization: Training progress and performance metrics are plotted using Matplotlib.

### 4. Results
- Achieved high accuracy in classifying waste into "Organic" and "Recyclable" categories.
- Insights into the datasetâ€™s composition were visualized using pie charts.
